## Brief Intro of the app

We would like to do a trip planner app, which allows user to manage their planning trips and set up their schedules for those travels. The main functionalities are managing  trips, planning the potential destinations and schedules of the trip and maybe setting up them inside the system calendar. We will not include any recommendations or other advertisements inside this app. 

## Major User Interface Elements

## Weekly Schedule

## Attempted APIs

- Map APIs
  
  We plan to use google map apis for this app to show users the locations. 

- Database
  
  We plan to use Firebase to manage all the authentication data and users' trip data. 

- Calendar API (potential)
  
  We plan to use calendar apis to help user import their schedule into the calendar. This is a stretch goal for the project. 

## Functional Specification

1. We will have a login system (using firebase). 

2. We will have a to-trip list as our main view to users, where users can add, delete or modify their plans for each trip. 

3. We will include a map function inside the app to show the locations to the users.

4. Inside a trip, users can add/delete/edit their destinations, time schedules (optional) and comments (optional) if they want. 

## Discussion of Other Similar Apps

#### Wanderlog

This is a trip planning app, which allows users to have a detailed plan of all the reservations in a destination including flights, car rentals, buses, trains and so forth. The app also includes expenses statistics, which will allow users to set a budget or count their total expenses. 

Our app is aimed to be simple and clear. It will be like a to-trip list, containing only where and when to go. A person can have a plan for future 5 years where he would love to visit and record his thoughts on this app. Unlike Wanderlog or other great planning apps, the plan in our app is much more like an outline. 

## Our Inspiration

Our inspiration comes from the combination of todo list and trip planner. We would love to make a relatively simple app only to help people make a schedule on their trip, containing (when and) where to go.
